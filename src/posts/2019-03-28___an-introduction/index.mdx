In a little less than 24 hours my wife and I will be leaving the UK for a year.
12 months, give or take a few days, travelling to 18 countries and trying to do
it on a pretty strict budget.

In that time I'll be trying to
[learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) (while still
taking time to sunbathe!) as a way of developing as, well, a developer.

My main long-term project is the rebuild of
[Jarvis 99-40](https://jarvis9940.com) - currently running on PHP, I want to get
this moved to React (though I'm not yet sure what's going to handle the
websocket connection).

I've also got a <Link to="/current-projects">few more projects</Link> rattling
around in my brain that I'd like to build, mostly to see where they go.
