This page is designed to be a constantly updating and evolving record of projects as I work on them.

## Currently building

**Jarvis 99-40 ([github](https://github.com/nomadjsdev/jarvis-9940))** - A rewrite of an existing project, Jarvis 99-40 is a visual interface for gamers who can't rely on sound when playing. Primarly aimed at Deaf players of Destiny, the rewrite uses Firebase Realtime Database to implement websocket connections allowing real-time soundless communication between players.

**Jarvis 99-40 Admin ([github](https://github.com/nomadjsdev/jarvis-9940-admin))** - The admin portal for Jarvis 99-40, allowing authorised users to build or edit the templates that the main site uses.

**Jarvis 99-40 Components ([github](https://github.com/nomadjsdev/jarvis-9940-components))** - A shared library of components for Jarvis 99-40 and the admin portal, ensuring consistent visuals.

**Destiny Clan Assistant ([github](https://github.com/nomadjsdev/clan-assistant))** - Using the Bungie API to collect clan data, this app aims to fulfil a missing niche in Destiny's player experience; group scheduling!

## Completed projects
