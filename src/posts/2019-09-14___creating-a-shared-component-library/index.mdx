import { Link } from 'gatsby'

One of my current projects (<Link to="/current-projects">I have a few</Link>) is
divided into two separate repositories - one app for users, another for admin.
Both use components which need to look identical, to ensure that layouts on the
user app (which are created in the admin app) are correct.

There are a few ways this can be achieved:

### Manually copy component code between the two repositories

We're not monsters, and this isn't the dark ages. This option is a hard pass.

### Create an npm package and publish it

A better option, and if the component library was more generalised this is
probably the way I'd choose to go.

### Create a third repository and install directly into the other projects

Now we're talking. This separates our components into a single source of truth
so we don't have to edit in more than one place, and we don't have to go through
the hassle of creating an NPM package.

## Where to start

To make things simple, get started with `Create-React-App`. Sure, you won't need
all the functionality it offers, but it handles all the initial setup for you
and you can prune the unnecessary parts later.

Quick tip: try to use a distinctive name for your library, to avoid package name
clashes in your other projects. `my-shared-library` is probably not a great
name!

```bash
yarn create react-app my-shared-library
# or
npx create-react-app my-shared-library
# (I'll be using yarn from now on)
```

## Add your components (and style them)

There's a few handy libraries you may want to use for this:

```bash
yarn add --dev react-styleguidist
yarn add prop-types styled-components
```

[Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) is great for creating living
style guides for component libraries.

Edit your `package.json` scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "npx styleguidist server",
  "build": "npx styleguidist build",
},
```

And create a `README.md` in each of your component directories showing different
variations of the component

````markdown
Basic button

```js
<Button>Button</Button>
```

Large button

```js
<Button size='large'>Button</Button>
```
````

[prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) is great for providing
prop hints when using the component

```javascript
Button.defaultProps = {
  size: 'regular'
}

Button.propTypes = {
  size: PropTypes.oneOf(['regular', 'large'])
}
```

And [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) is a great way of
providing styling

```javascript
export const StyledButton = styled.button`
  border: none;
  background: hotpink;
  border-radius: 4px;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
`
```

**NOTE** If you use styled-components with Styleguidist you'll need to identify
the component export using JSDoc notation, otherwise Styleguidist will try to
use the styled-component items

```javascript
/** @component */
export default Button
```

## Add exports to your main `index.js`

```javascript
export { default as Button } from './Components/Button'
```

## Push to your remote, and install in your other projects

```bash
yarn add https://path-to-my-shared-library-repo
```

## Profit!

You can use the components in your other projects now

```javascript
import { Button } from 'my-shared-library'
```
