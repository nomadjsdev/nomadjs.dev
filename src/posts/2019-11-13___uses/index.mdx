Nobody asked, but inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) (courtesy of
[Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/uses/)) here's my list.

## Editor + terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - this replaced Sublime
  Text v2
  - [Night Owl theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl),
    Consolas font
  - [vscode-workspace-switcher](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sadesyllas.vscode-workspace-switcher)
  - [Turbo Console Log](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChakrounAnas.turbo-console-log)
  - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
  - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - [CRA Tasks After Init](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nomadjsdev.cra-tasks-after-init)
  - [CRA Create New](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nomadjsdev.cra-create-new)
- [Cmder](https://cmder.net/) - console emulator, has great support for git,
  bash, and PowerShell.
- [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) - this might be the terminal to replace Cmder, but
  it's not there yet.

## Chrome extensions

- UBlock Origin
- JSON Formatter

## Desktop apps

- [Fork](https://git-fork.com/) - replaced GitKraken when it went paid-only.
- [Keepass 2](https://keepass.info/) - simple password manager that I sync via
  Dropbox.
- [Nord VPN](https://nordvpn.com/) - best balance of privacy, security, and
  cost.

## Mobile apps

- Microsoft To Do - organises my work life.
- Keep notes - organises my personal life.
- Google Calendar - organises everything else.
- Google Authenticator - 2FA is important.
- Nord VPN
- Cloudflare DNS
- Afterlight - for editing so I can get all those likes on Instagram.
- Relay - for wasting all my time on Reddit.
- Duolingo - I'm learning Spanish and Welsh, slowly.
- MAPS.ME - offline maps, great for finding smaller walking paths in odd
  countries.

## Hardware
