Humans are versatile. We can be pretty good at repetitive tasks. But computers
are better. Way better. There are a bunch of quick, little, boring tasks that we
do every days when coding which really should be handled by scripts, extensions,
plugins, or robots instead.

If you have to do it more than a few times, and it's easy to automate, then _why
haven't you automated it already?_

The more often you have to do the task, and the more tedious it is, the more
likely it is you'll make a mistake doing it. Would it be the end of the world if
you forgot to move a particular file, or rename a certain directory? Of course
not, you can probably go back and do it later. But it will be one more little
annoyance added on to the pile of decision fatigue and sleep deprivation.

So automate the boring things.

Python is apparently good for this - there's a
[book series](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) which may or may not have
inspired this post - but I don't know Python (yet).

Most of my boring, repetitive tasks happen in VSCode though, and VSCode has a
fantastic extension system. Probably there's a few extensions that will ease my
pain, but why go looking for someone else's work when the problem is so small?

It's a perfect opportunity to learn, instead :)

My annoyances, as of the moment:

- ~~I have to clean up the boilerplate that Create-React-App produces every time
  I start a project.~~

- ~~Creating new Views or Components - so many clicks!~~
  - Updated 2020-01-04: <Link to="/cra-create-new">Extension!</Link>
- ~~Add authentication and database access to projects - I typically use
  Firebase, so this could surely be templated?~~
