I'm a big fan of _automating the boring things_ - if you have to do a task more
than a few times, and it's easy to automate, then _why haven't you automated it
already?_

For instance, every time I `yarn create react-app` I spend a bunch of time
removing all the boilerplate that I don't use. A perfect candidate for
automation, and a great learning opportunity as I had never created a VSCode
extension before. Turns out it's pretty easy.

So **CRA Tasks After Init**
([marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nomadjsdev.cra-tasks-after-init) -
[github](https://github.com/nomadjsdev/CRATasksAfterInit-vsCodeExtension)) was
born. Modelled after a Wordpress plugin called "WP Tasks After Install" this
extension is designed to get in, delete a bunch of stuff, and get out again.

It's opinionated as hell, and probably not suitable for many other people, but
for my first foray into VSCode extensions I'm happy enough with it and there's
plenty of scope for improvement later on.
