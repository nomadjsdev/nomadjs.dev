2019 has been busy, though not full of work. Since April my wife and I have been
travelling, and while I thought that this would give me plenty of time to build
projects and learn a tonne, the reality is that there's a whole lot to see in the world and my time management leaves a lot to be desired.

I also had very vague 'goals' set for the year, which meant I didn't have
structure to my learning or development.

## Highlights of 2019

I have:

- seen a lot of new places (16 countries so far) and met a lot of new people
- made huge strides on rebuilding my main project,
  <Link to="/jarvis-99-40">Jarvis 99-40</Link>
- created the basis for my second main project, a social assistant for gaming
  clans
- created my first (incredibly simple) VSCode extension
- created or handed off 3 client projects (including a Shopify store for the
  first time)
- consolidated all the servers I had running, and moved projects towards Netlify
  where possible

## Goals for 2020

I will:

- **Launch the all-new [Jarvis 99-40](https://jarvis9940.com)** (and also update
  Jarvis with the features on the roadmap up to v1.4)
- **Launch the Clan Assistant.** I'm at the stage of calendar integration on this project, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it grows.
- **Launch at least two projects from my <Link to="/current-projects">'planned
  projects'</Link> list**
- **Get a job.** We're returning home in April, and we've given ourselves 3
  months to either get employed, or build our own sources of income.
- **Pick up some Python or Golang**
- **Get healthy.** This year has been a never-ending feast of food and snacks,
  and not enough exercise. I'm looking forward to getting back on a meal and
  fitness plan, and so:
- **Run a half marathon.** We completed the Brighton Marathon in 2018 and I
  swore I would never run anywhere again. So naturally we're going to build back
  up into another marathon.
