I make two types of web app:

1. Doesn't need authentication on the backend
2. Makes me want to abandon front-end development forever

Adding authentication to an app can be pretty painful, especially if it's not
your area of expertise. It's certainly something I struggle with frequently, and
the available tutorials can get pretty long. Far too long to go through each
time.

So, for little apps which still need secure login, why rebuild the wheel each
time? (I rebuilt the wheel at least 12 times before making this template)

**CRA-RTK** ([github](https://github.com/nomadjsdev/cra-rtk)) is a template
based on Create-React-App which includes Google Firebase for authentication and
Redux-Toolkit for handling state. It also has Formik (though this will get
replaced with `react-hook-form` next time I update versions), React Router,
ESLint (using the AirBnB rules) and Prettier.

Basically all the stuff I set up each time I start a new project.
