I ran a quick test and it seems that I spend roughly 18 hours every single day
creating new `View` or `Component` files in React apps.

So; **CRA Create New**
([marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nomadjsdev.cra-create-new) -
[github](http://localhost:3000/current-projects)). Again, very opinionated (I
built it for me, after all) all it does is create a directory, `<Name>` with an
`index.js` file which exports from `<Name>.js` and templates this with a simple
functional component.

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const Name = () => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <h1>Name</h1>
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}

export default Name
```

Super simple, but saves me a tonne of time and a good starting place for more
learning and improvement later on.
