If you know what Jarvis is all about, you can probably skip this first section.
For a quick intro, read on!

## What is Jarvis 99-40?

The inspiration for Jarvis came in
[a post](https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/72q7k7/help_wanted_web_app_developement_creating_visual/)
made by [Maverick](https://old.reddit.com/user/M4V3R1C8) on the
`/r/DestinyTheGame` subreddit on 2017-09-27.

Players of the video game Destiny 2 who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing were
struggling with a piece of end-game content which seemed to be designed with
voice communication in mind. Maverick was seeking help creating a system which
aimed to make these encounters slightly easier, as players were currently
relying on in-game emotes, Discord, or signing via Skype.

This system was launched as Jarvis 99-40, and allowed players to communicate
using symbols on a webpage which update in realtime for every player in the
session. All the layouts so far have been designed by Maverick.

## The release history of Jarvis

The `Alpha` release of Jarvis was on 2017-10-11, and was originally written in
PHP using the Laravel framework, backed with a MariaDB database and a websocket
server for handling the realtime communication. At the time I was using PHP
extensively, and wanted to both learn more about Laravel and use a language I
could iterate quickly with.

This release went well enough as a test, but Laravel quickly proved to be more
of a hindrance than a help. So I migrated the codebase.

The `Beta` release of Jarvis was on 2018-01-18 and was also written in PHP,
though without a main framework. It made use of the Huge authentication
framework by Panique and the same websocket server as the Alpha. As the user
authentication method changed (along with the database behind it) this required
users to re-register. Kind of a pain in the ass, but unfortunately we're not
done yet.

The `Gamma` release of Jarvis is currently being tested, and is a complete
rewrite to ReactJS, using Google's Firebase Authentication to handle users and
Firebase Realtime Database to handle the realtime communication in place of the
websocket server. This means that I won't have to run a websocket instance on my
server which makes maintenance and server migration for other apps a bit easier
to manage, and should also provide a more stable and smooth deployment process
for new releases as well as slightly faster communication between player
sessions.

Moving authentication processing out to a third party service like Firebase
means that if the main codebase ever gets migrated again, user accounts will
remain.

The main motivation behind the latest migration is moving to a more supportable
ecosystem with automated deployments, which will in turn allow for simpler
collaboration. The current `Beta` version makes it difficult to manage
collaboration, and hopefully the newer build will prove better in the long term.

This new setup also allows for new encounters and layouts to be created
dynamically, rather than being hard-coded. Later down the line we'll be able to
authorise certain accounts as editors who can build their own layouts.

## So what does all this mean for current users?

If you want to create new sessions for a game, you'll need to register a new
account. Sorry about that. This will (unless Google shuts down Firebase Auth) be
the last time that re-registering is required - I really don't want to rewrite
the authentication system again!

However, if you only want to join a session there's now **no need to register**!
Just pick a temporary username and enter the session code and you'll connect.
This is something that wasn't really possible with the `Beta` version and was
one of the main drivers for rewriting to React.

Existing user accounts from the `Beta` service will follow the user accounts
from the Alpha and be deleted with extreme prejudice. Once the `Gamma` version
is up and running there will be no data kept from the `Beta` other than
historical (anonymous) usage statistics.

## Any new features appearing?

For now the only new feature is being able to join sessions without registering.
There are a few other new features lined up though; an option to create a
permanent session ID, voice-to-action, personalised keyboard bindings, clan
spaces, being able to assign roles within game sessions, and a few more.

## Any features disappearing?

A few, for now.

- Text-to-audio is temporarily disabled
- Keyboard bindings are temporarily disabled
- Chat is temporarily disabled
- Encounter instructions have been removed

All these features will return, but my focus will be on ensuring the new system
is stable and fast enough, and bringing new encounters to Jarvis.

## When are all these features returning?

Dates to be confirmed. Following the example of `react-beautiful-dnd`, I won't
be shipping new features if there are any reported bugs or issues outstanding.

A loose idea of new release order:

- v1.0 - the `Gamma` release
- v1.1 - previously included features like static keyboard bindings, chat, etc.
  coming ASAP
- v1.2 - permanent session IDs, assign roles
- v1.3 - clan spaces
- v1.4 - personalised key bindings
- v1.5 - 1.xx - other features if necessary
- v2.0 - new games added

From v1.2 onwards the order is up for debate as new features are thought up or
priorities re-assessed.

## How much will the all-shiny-new Jarvis cost to use?

The same as the current version: Zip. Nada. Nothing. Free (as in beer).

I'm committed to keeping all the essential features of Jarvis free for everyone.

If server costs get out of control I may implement some of the extra features
like clan spaces behind a donation-only account level, but I would prefer to
have all features free for everyone. I would rather set up optional donations
rather than buy-in features.

In any case, changes will be communicated well in advance, with a chance for
feedback.

There will never be adverts on Jarvis 99-40, because adverts suck. Seriously, go
get uBlock Origin for all your browsers (even mobile Firefox) and never watch a
crappy advert on YouTube ever again.

## What's with the name?

In Destiny, robot frames with the designation '99-40' are simple helper-bots.
And when it comes to helper-bots, who could be more helpful than Jarvis?

Also I suck at naming things.
